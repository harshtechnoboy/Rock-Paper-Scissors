# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" played between a user and a computer. The game is written in Python and provides an interactive command-line interface.

## How to Play

Follow these steps to play the game:

1. **Clone or Download** the repository to your local machine: Click on the "Clone or download" button on the GitHub repository page and choose the appropriate option to clone the repository using Git or download it as a ZIP file. If you choose to download it as a ZIP file, extract the contents to a desired location on your computer.

2. **Install Python**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository. Run the script `rock_paper_scissors.py` by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python rock_paper_scissors.py
   ```

4. **Enter Your Choice**: The game will prompt you to enter your choice by typing "rock", "paper", or "scissors". Make your selection and press Enter. You can also enter "Q" at any time to quit the game.

5. **View the Result**: The computer will randomly choose its option, and the game will display the computer's choice along with the outcome of the round. If you win, it will show "You Won!". If you lose, it will display "You Lost :(". In case of a tie, it will show "It's a Tie!".

6. **Continue or Quit**: After each round, you can choose to continue playing by entering another choice, or you can quit the game by entering "Q" when prompted. The game will keep track of the total number of wins for both you and the computer.

7. **Final Scores**: Once you decide to quit the game by entering "Q", the final scores (number of wins for the user and computer) will be displayed. This will give you an overview of your performance in the game.

## Dependencies
